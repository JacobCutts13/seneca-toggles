## Assumptions: 

- Each question set is stored with a unique id.
- Questions stored in Json format. The 0 Id option is the correct option.
- Each question has 2-3 options

## Limitations:
- Only three levels of tile themes can make sets with >4 questions hard to know when your on the right track.
- Plain CSS used instead of a framework- this was to show my raw CSS ability.
- Limited testing. My main utility function was a random sort so and I was only able to test edge cases. 
- Navbar position doesn't stay fixed on mobile.

## Extras:
- Vertical slider depends on the options charcter length, and screen size (using an event listener).
- Navigation buttons that match the colour of their tile.
- No limit on the number of questions in a set. 


Thanks for the project was a lot of fun! I hope you find my solution interesting :)
